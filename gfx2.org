gfx2 - reapply gfxscreen branch to new branch

Old branch would compile but not run correctly.  Need to start fresh
and apply changes individually to see what is breaking.

* Changes and Compile Tests
** defs/f256vtio.d
+ apply changes and add new gfx variables to file
+ Compiled and tested, everything works
+ Prior issue may have been ORG 0 command which put the keyboard buffer at 0
  + that would have broken the whole system
** level1/f256/modules/vtio.asm
+ add code for f256 graphic
+ compiled and tested, term still works
** level1/f256/modules/gfx1.asm
+ add device descriptor
  TODO: Change memory address  *DONE*
  + change physical controller address to $C001
** level2/f256/modules/makefile
+ add gfx1.dt to line 23 in scf section
** level2/f256/bootfiles/makefile
+ add gfx1.dt to scf video termial line 36
* Structure
** Globals
*** os9.d
  + D.CCMem is defined in os9.d at 616 which points to graphics global memory pointer ($1000)
*** krn.asm  
  + D.CCMem is set to $1000 in krn.asm line 296
*** cocovtio.d
  + G.CurDev line 624 = current device's static memory pointer
  + G.CurDevFl line 606 = current device flag
  + G.WinType line 614 = current device's V.Type
  + G.PrWMPt line 625 = previous window staties mem pointer
** Init vtio.asm
  + stores U in G.Curdev line 198
  + Gets process decriptor and makes current process, lines 221-222 (why?)
    #+begin_src
      ldd       <D.SysPrc           get system process desc ptr
